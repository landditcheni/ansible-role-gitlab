In this article, we will show you some of the features and benefits of InfraWorks 2014, and how you can get started with this powerful tool.
 
## Features and Benefits of InfraWorks 2014
 
InfraWorks 2014 has many features and benefits that make it a great choice for civil infrastructure design and planning. Here are some of them:
 
- You can import data from various sources, such as GIS, CAD, BIM, LiDAR, and aerial imagery, and use them to create realistic 3D models of your project area.
- You can use sketching tools, parametric models, and style rules to quickly design and modify your infrastructure elements, such as roads, bridges, buildings, and vegetation.
- You can analyze your design alternatives using various criteria, such as traffic simulation, drainage analysis, cost estimation, and environmental impact.
- You can create stunning visualizations and animations of your project using ray traced rendering, shadows, lighting, and effects.
- You can collaborate with other team members and stakeholders using cloud services, such as Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro. You can also export your models to other Autodesk software, such as AutoCAD Civil 3D and Revit.

## How to Get Started with InfraWorks 2014
 
If you want to try InfraWorks 2014 for yourself, you can download a free version from the developer's website[^2^]. You will need a Windows 7 or Windows 8 64-bit operating system, a dual-core processor (quad-core or better recommended), 4 GB of RAM (16+ GB recommended), a DirectX 10.1 capable graphics card with 2 GB of memory (or more), and 10 GB of free disk space.
 
Once you have installed InfraWorks 2014 on your computer, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop icon. You will see a welcome screen that gives you access to various resources, such as tutorials, videos, forums, and help. You can also start a new project or open an existing one from here.
 
To create a new project, you need to specify a name and a location for your project folder. You can also choose a coordinate system and a base map for your project. A base map is an image that provides geographic context for your model. You can use one of the default base maps provided by Autodesk or Bing Maps, or you can import your own image or data.
 
After creating your project, you will see the main interface of InfraWorks 2014. It consists of four main areas: the ribbon, the canvas, the model explorer, and the viewport controls. The ribbon contains various tools and commands for working with your model. The canvas is where you view and interact with your model. The model explorer shows the hierarchy of data sources and model elements in your project. The viewport controls allow you to change the view mode, perspective, zoom level, orientation, and display settings of your model.
 
To start designing your infrastructure elements, you can use the tools in the Create tab of the ribbon. You can sketch roads, bridges, buildings, water areas, coverage areas, city furniture, trees, and more on the canvas. You can also import data from other sources using the Data Sources tab of the ribbon. You can edit the properties and styles of your elements using the Stack panel on the right side of the canvas.
 
To analyze your design alternatives, you can use the tools in the Analyze tab of the ribbon. You can run traffic simulation scenarios using the Traffic Simulation panel on the left side of the canvas. You can also perform drainage analysis using the Drainage Design panel on the right side of the canvas. You can compare different design options using bookmarks or scenarios.
