# How to Play Tom Clancy's Hawx 2 Offline Without Uplay
 
Tom Clancy's Hawx 2 is a combat flight simulator game that was released in 2010 by Ubisoft. The game features a variety of planes, missions, and modes, as well as a story that ties in with other Tom Clancy franchises. However, some players may have trouble playing the game offline due to the requirement of Uplay, Ubisoft's online service platform. Uplay can be annoying for some players who want to enjoy the game without an internet connection or without creating an account. Fortunately, there is a way to play Tom Clancy's Hawx 2 offline without Uplay, thanks to a crack file that bypasses the online check.

The crack file is called TOM.CLANCYS.HAWX.2.V1.01.ALL.DEMDE.STEAM006.ZIP and it can be downloaded from various sources on the internet[^1^] [^2^]. The file contains an offline patch and an ownership file that trick the game into thinking that it is running on Uplay. To use the crack file, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure you have installed the game and updated it to version 1.01.
2. Download the crack file and extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Copy the contents of the extracted folder into your Ubisoft Game Launcher folder, which is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher.
4. Rename the cache/ownership file to your custom profile ID. You can find your profile ID by opening Uplay and clicking on your username in the top right corner. It should be a string of numbers and letters.
5. Make the cache/ownership file read only by right-clicking on it, selecting Properties, and checking the Read-only box under Attributes.
6. Make Uplay start always in offline mode by opening Uplay, clicking on Settings, and checking the Always start Uplay in offline mode box under General.
7. Launch the game from your desktop shortcut or from the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder. You should be able to play offline without Uplay.

Note that this crack file may not work for everyone and may cause some issues with the game. Use it at your own risk and make sure you backup your original files before applying the crack. Also, be aware that using a crack file may violate the terms of service of Ubisoft and may result in a ban or other consequences.
